VE477 Lab 8

In this lab we want to provide a preview of linear programming. There will be no coding, but rather simple questions to investigate.

Ex. 1 — General questions

General questions:

    What is linear programming?

    Provide examples of situations where linear programming is used in practice.

    What are the standard and slack forms and how good are they to express a linear program?

    What algorithms exist to solve linear programs? Provide a simple but clear description of the simplex method.

    What is duality and when could it be applied when running the simplex method?

Ex. 2 — Toy example for the simplex method

1. We are interested in the following linear programming problem P. Minimize −2x1 + 3x2, subject to

                                		

                                −
                                		

                                ≤
                                	
                                	

                                x1
                                		
                                	

                                + x2
                                	

                                = 7
                                					
                                					

                                x1
                                		

                                2x2
                                		

                                4
                                					
                                					
                                					
                                				

                                ≥ 0.

                                x1
                                		

        Rewrite P in standard form.

        rewrite P in slack form.

    Apply the simplex method to the following linear problem expressed in slack form by

z = 3x1 + x2 + 2x3

x4 =30 − x1 − x2 − 3x3

x5 =24 − 2x1 − 2x2 − 5x3

x6 =36 − 4x1 − x2 − 2x3.
